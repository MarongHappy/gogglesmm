Getting Started

  See the INSTALL file on how to build gogglesmm. You can skip the install part and run gogglesmm
  directly from the source directory. For development or diagnosing an issue, you want to build
  gogglesmm with debug symbols. To do so, run cmake with the appropriate build type:

  > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

  To run gogglesmm directly from the source directory, you need tell gogglesmm where to find the output plugins.
  By default it will try to find them in <install_prefix>/lib/gogglesmm, but you can set the GOGGLESMM_PLUGIN_PATH
  environment variable to specify an alternate location:

  > export GOGGLESMM_PLUGIN_PATH=gap
  > src/gogglesmm

  With the debug build enabled, it should print out the filename of the 
  output plugin when gogglesmm starts playing:

  [output] loading plugin: gap/libgap_pulse.so
