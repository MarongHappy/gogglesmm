Upgrading from 0.12.x
---------------------

  If you're upgrading you will have to re-import your music due to changes in the database.

  Use the import_gogglesmm12.py script to copy the radio streams into the new database. It will also export all
  the playlists into m3u files, which may be used to recreate the playlists in the new database.

  Once all files have been imported, you can use the import_gogglesmm12_stats.py script to transfer the playcount
  statistics into the new database.
